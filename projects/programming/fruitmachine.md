At the beginning of Extended ASCII (an entire byte (8 bits) instead of 7 bits in ASCII) you will find some interesting characters on the Windows platform.


Use the clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠) characters to make a fruit machine.

Get the user to pull the one-armed-bandit lever and output three random numbers represented in the range 3-6 as extended-ascii. Give the player points if the three numbers are equal.

Example:

Welcome to Fruit Machine

Type (1) to insert coins. Type (2) to pull the lever and try your luck.

Coins: 5

> 2

(♣) (♦) (♥)

Better luck next time

Coins: 4

Score: 0

Type (1) to insert coins. Type (2) to pull the lever and try your luck.
