<p>You may have noticed you can’t really print out from C++?</p>
<p>cout &lt;&lt; “”;</p>
<p>That will just give you a newline.</p>
<p>To print out “” you need to use the espace character. “"</p>
<p>cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;</p>
<p>Write a program which does the above for newline and tab ( and quote
and backslash</p>
