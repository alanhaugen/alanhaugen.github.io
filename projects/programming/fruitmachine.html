<p>At the beginning of Extended ASCII (an entire byte (8 bits) instead
of 7 in ASCII) you will find some interesting characters on the Windows
platform.</p>
<p>Use the clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠)
characters to make a fruit machine.</p>
<p>Get the user to pull the one-armed-bandit lever and output three
random numbers represented in the range 3-6 as extended-ascii. Give the
player points if the three numbers are equal.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Welcome to Fruit Machine</p>
<p>Type (1) to insert coins. Type (2) to pull the lever and try your
luck.</p>
<p>Coins: 5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(♣) (♦) (♥)</p>
<p>Better luck next time</p>
<p>Coins: 4</p>
<p>Score: 0</p>
<p>Type (1) to insert coins. Type (2) to pull the lever and try your
luck.</p>
